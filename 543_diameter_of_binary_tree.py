# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


# Example 1:

#       1
#      / \
#     2   3
#    / \
#   4   5

# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [1,2]
# Output: 1

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
